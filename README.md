# Algorithms Visualizer in C++ with ImGui


## Description
This is a simple project I intend to use to better understand and visualize algorithms. I will be using ImGui for the GUI and C++ for the backend. I use OpenGL_3 for rendering and SDL2 for window management.

## Disclaimer
This project is intended to be a learning experience for me or more like a playground to experiment with different algorithms and data structures or any other ideas that might pop into my head. I am also taking this as an opportunity to improve my C++ skills and learn more about building GUI applications in C++.
